# churn_prediction

This is a simple churn prediction app made using the dataset from an old kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/customer-churn-prediction-2020/data 

To run, make sure to have all dependancies installed or install them using `pip install requirements.txt`

Then launch the app with `streamlit run app.py`

This short project is mostly inspired by the following video from Nicholas Renotte on Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebb4gUI2IpQ&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte
